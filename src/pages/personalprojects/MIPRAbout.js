                Michigan Melee Power Ranking
                </a> is a tradition the community has upheld since 2010. 
      It is a ranking of the top players in Michigan based on their performance in tournaments.  
      The PR is updated every 6 months or so and is determined by a panel of community members who vote on the rankings based on tournament results, head-to-head matchups, and other factors. 
      The PR is a great way to recognize the top players in the community and to motivate players to improve their skills and compete at a higher level. 
      Originally the PR, in a time without online play, showcased a local scene's top players for when out-of-state players would come to Michigan for tournaments.

      I am part of a core panel of 2-3 people who organize the process for PR voting.
