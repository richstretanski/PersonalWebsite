                This is an archive of some of my academic projects that I worked on while studying Digital Marketing (Undergraduate), Information Technology Management (Undergraduate), and Information Security (Graduate) at the University of Michigan-Dearborn. Many of my projects were team projects since the College of Business values being able to work well in a team setting. If a project was a team project, contributors were credited as such.

                At some point, I may link the documents referenced, but for now, I'm going to leave them as project summaries.
